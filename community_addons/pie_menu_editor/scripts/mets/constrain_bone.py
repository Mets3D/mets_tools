# Perhaps another pie menu for applying my most used constraints:
# 1. Edit Constraint -> List of Constraints -> Pop-up panel of the constraint (might be tricky with constraints that have sub-panels... But we could also implement our own UI here.)
# 2. Add Constraints
    # Set-up Action Constraints
    # World Space
        # Transformation
        # Maintain Volume
        # Copy
            # Transforms
            # Location
            # Rotation
            # Scale
        # Limit
            # Location
            # Rotation
            # Scale
            # Distance
    # Local Space
        # Transformation
        # Maintain Volume
        # Copy
            # Location (With offset)
            # Rotation (With Before Original blend mode)
            # Scale (With Additive mix mode, I guess default?)
        # Limit
            # Location
            # Rotation
            # Scale
            # Distance
# 3. Symmetrize
# 4. Disable Constraints
# 5. Remove Constraints
# 6. Clear All Constraints
# 7. Copy Constraints
